## Britta Max

> **Hint**. {{ page.hint }}

The capacity of a [Brita Max Dispenser](https://amzn.to/2sTzBvR){:title='Click to Visit the Landing page for the Brita Ultra Max 18 cup Filtering Dispenser'}{:target='_blank'} water filter container is Eighteen (18) cups, or 144 ounces.

**Note**. A [Brita Standard Filter](https://amzn.to/38mVZy4){:title='Click to Visit the Landing page for the Brita Standard Filter 4 count'}{:target='_blank'} will treat approximately Forty (40) gallons of tap water.

If you are brewing the standard Eight (8) x Thirty-two (32) ounce bottles of finished brew (approx. 256 ounces, or 2-gallons) then each Brita standard filter will accommodate approximately Twenty (20) 2-gallon brew sessions at a cost of approx. 11 cents (USD) per gallon, or 22 cents (USD) per 2-gallon brew session, or 3 cents (USD) per 32-ounce bottle of finished brew.

## Measurements

8 ounces = 1 cup

4 cups = 32 ounces

1 gall = 128 ounces

128 ounces = 16 cups

Less: 4 cups = 12 cups

## Brew Session

So, when filling your Two (2) gallon brew vessel (keg) ...

1.) Start w 4 cups of filtered water

2.) Pour the 4 cups of filtered water into a clean brew pot and subject the filtered water to the maximum heat of your burner.

3.) When the filtered water achieves a boil (212 deg F or 100 deg C), turn off the burner and move the brew pot off the burner to a neutral mount.

4.) Next, pour the contents of your chosen thick, viscous Standard 2-gallon Hops & Malt Extract (HME), or the [Oktoberfest Lager HME](https://amzn.to/38mVZy4){:title='Click to Visit the Landing page for the Standard 2-gallon Hops & Malt Extract for Oktoberfest Lager'}{:target='_blank'} into the brew pot and stir, stir, stir while the water is HOT!

**Note**. The `#HME` is a very thick, molasses-like blend.

To thin it out a bit, submerge the un-opened can of `#HME` in a scalding hot bath of super-hot tap water for about 15 minutes.

**Note**. Be sure to dunk your can opener in a separate bath of [Oxy Brew Wash](https://amzn.to/2RHcS0i){:title='Click to Visit the Landing page for Oxygen Brewery Wash by National Chemical'}{:target='_blank'} for about Five (5) minutes while your `#HME` is warming up and thinning out BEFORE opening the can of now thinned `#HME` to ensure NO CONTAMINATION of the brew substrate.

5.) Now, pour an additional Twelve (12) cups of Cold filtered water into the bottom of your 2-gallon brew keg.

**Note**. Be sure to place your filtered water reservoir into your fridge the night before your brew session in order to chill the filtered water deeply as required for a successful brew.

6.) Now pour your thoroughly mixed and diluted very warm `#HME` directly into your brew kettle.

**Note**. A standard container of `#HME` (enough to brew 2-gallons of craft beer), weighs in at 1.3 kilos. How many cups of water the standard size `#HME` displaces is still a mystery.

7.) Swish, shake, and stir your now half-full brew keg to ensure your now very diluted `#HME` conforms to your brew vessel uniformally.

8.) Top off your mixture with more Cold filtered water, approximately Sixteen (16) more cups to acheive the two (2) gallon fill line of your 2-gallon brew vessel.

9.) Swish and stir your now full brew keg once again.

10.) Your brew is now ready to receive its yeast.

Take the yeast packet and snip the top of the yeast packet with a clean scissor.

11.) When the sea of brew liquid has calmed down inside of your brew keg, sprinkle the yeast packet straight down the center of your brew vessel.

12.) There is no need to shake, stir, or spin your brew liquid again at this time.

The yeast will go to work immediately without further agitation.

15.) Screw the seal (lid) back onto your brew keg and place your now full and working brew vessel on a shelf in a dark closet with the door closed for Ten (10) days and (10) nights minimum with a maximum of Twenty-one (21) days in the brew vessel before beginning your bottling session.
